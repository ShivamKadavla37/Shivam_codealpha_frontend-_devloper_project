# Shivam_codealpha_frontend-_devloper_project
A collection of 3 web projects built during my internship: a responsive portfolio website, a basic calculator app, and Vision Gallery â€” a stylish image gallery with smooth transitions. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my frontend skills.
